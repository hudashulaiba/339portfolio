- flesh out content (focus on essays, PLANNING, and main page)
 At least four pages must have a minimum of three paragraphs of text 
 or five images or a combination of images and text.  This is a minimum

- One page should have at least nine distinct images contained in a SINGLE CONTAINER
 These images should use filters and pseudo-classes to animate/augment them. 
 (So change opacity, border, etc.)

- GRID
 Your site must have a component that uses grid
 (copying code from previous assignment will only be partial credit)
 The grid layout must change in each of your three screen sizes
 You must include in your submission documentation on where to find the grid being used effectively.
 Changing from one to two to three columns will earn some but not all credit.

- FLEX
 Your site must have a component that uses flexbox
 (copying code from previous assignment will only be partial credit)
 The flex layout must change in each of your three screen sizes
 You must include in your submission documentation on where to find flex being used effectively.
 You will need to be creative to get full credit for the flex
 do something that demonstrates advanced understanding.


- FLIP CARD
 A keyboard-accessible flip card using just CSS
 Make sure to write a media query to turn it off as well.

- Media queries for two additional layouts - tablet, and larger screen.
    - The navigation must differ on all three views in a way that makes the site easier to use.
    - The media queries should also trigger structural changes to at least two of the pages
        the flow of elements must change, elements must hide, or grid/flex properties should be altered.  
    - Using flex does not count toward the responsive design objective 
        unless some of the flex properties are significantly updated using media queries.


- Your submission must include documentation of your responsive design choices and how you trigger them
    You must explain how your code improves the page, not just changes it.  

- Your documentation must include a demonstration of each page validating on Wave and aXe.

- A summary of the steps you took to ensure that your site addresses accessibility, diversity and inclusion.
